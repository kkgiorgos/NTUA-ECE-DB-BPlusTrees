# B+ Trees

This is an implementation of B+ Trees with the algorithms from [Database System Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/) book and the respective web UI using them. Made for [NTUA ECE Databases Course](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3123)

## Installation

The website was developed using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

For development use:

The resulting files are placed in the `dist` folder and can be statically served (using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) for example).
