# B+ Trees

This is an implementation of B+ Trees with the algorithms from [Database System Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/) book and the respective web UI using them. Made for [NTUA ECE Databases Course](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3123)

## Installation

The website was developed using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To install the dependency use:
```
npm install
```

For development use:
```
npm run dev
```

For deployment use:
```
npm run build
```
The resulting files are placed in the `dist` folder and can be statically served (using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) for example).

## Future Development

Possible improvements include:
1. Animated Tree Operations.
2. Saved State in browser's `localStorage`.
3. Pseudocode presentation and step by step execution.
